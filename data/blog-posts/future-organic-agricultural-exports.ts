  summary:
    "The trade war between the US and China which started in 2018 is still affecting economies around the world. What began as a disagreement between two countries over taxes and trade imbalances has grown into a complex geopolitical and economic rivalry that affects international investments supply lines and foreign relations. As of 2025 the issue has not been settled and both countries are taking smart steps to become less dependent on each other and show their authority in key areas.",

    <h4>Origins And Evolution Of The Trade War</h4>
    <p>In July 2018, the Trump administration put taxes on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods saying that they engaged in unfair trade practices and stole intellectual property. This was the official start of the U.S.-China trade war. China quickly responded with its taxes which led to a tit for tat rise in tensions. China promised to buy more U.S. goods and improve IP security in a "Phase One" trade deal signed in January 2020 but major problems were still not fixed.</p>
    <p>In the years since then, trade relations have stayed high under both Trump and Biden. Some tariffs have been changed but most of them are still in place. As of 2025 the Biden administration still has tariffs on more than $300 billion value of goods from China. In response China puts limits on its exports, especially tech goods. The war is no longer just about taxes, it also includes export bans, investment screening and industrial policies such as the CHIPS Act.</p>

    <h4>Global Supply Chain Disruptions</h4>
    <p>Global supply lines have changed because of the trade war. This is one of the most obvious and long term effects. As trade became less stable and taxes went up many international companies started moving their output out of China to lower their risks. This "China+1" plan has led to investments in India, Southeast Asia (mostly Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia) Mexico, and even Eastern Europe.</p>
    <p>Moving has not been easy. To change industrial hubs you need new facilities, skilled workers and reliable transportation. Countries like India have tried to take advantage of this chance by offering tax breaks and having policies like "Make in India". But businesses still have to deal with problems like slow government processes, infrastructure that isn't as good as China and small economies of scale.</p>
    <p>Global inflation and the COVID-19 outbreak made transportation costs and chip shortages even worse which made this change even harder to make. Companies are still trying to expand their production in 2025 but it is still expensive and takes a long time to completely separate from China.</p>

    <h4>Economic Interdependence And Geopolitical Balancing</h4>
    <p>The global economy is deeply linked and the U.S.-China's competition pushes many countries to carefully handle their ties with both powers. Trade with both the U.S. and China is very important for countries in the European Union, the Asia-Pacific region, and Africa. This has made it hard to be polite.</p>
    <p>The EU agrees with the U.S. on issues like human rights and tech restrictions but it also wants to keep dealing with China which is its second largest partner. Countries like Australia, South Korea, and Japan are in the same situation. They get economic benefits from China but want to be more like the West in terms of politics.</p>
    <p>As a result many countries are taking a more moderate or multi aligned stance. Groups like ASEAN support military independence and economic partnerships like RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) keep growing trade in the Asia Pacific region without a lot of help from the West.</p>

    <h4>Technological Rivalry And Global Consequences</h4>
    <p>The U.S.-China tech war is changing more than just trade. It is also changing creativity, R&D spending and global tech policy. The United States has put restrictions on the sale of important technologies such as powerful AI chips and tools used to make semiconductors. As a result China has stepped up its efforts to become self-sufficient through its "Made in China 2025" and "Dual Circulation" plans.</p>
    <p>In response the West has boosted innovation at home especially in areas like AI cybersecurity and green technology. Japan and South Korea have joined the U.S. in limiting chip exports to China. At the same time Taiwan, home to TSMC, the biggest chipmaker in the world, is in a dangerous political situation.</p>
    <p>Early in 2025 the U.S. put new limits on exports of AI chips and the EU is getting ready to do the same. This breaking apart of technologies is splintering the world tech environment and creating multiple supply lines which raises costs and lowers efficiency around the world.</p>


    <h4>CHIPS Act And Strategic Decoupling</h4>
    <p>The U.S. CHIPS Act which was passed in 2022 is a key part of its plan to become the world leader in chip production again. The Act gives more than 50 billion in grants and tax breaks to help the U.S. make more chips and depend less on East Asia.</p>
    <p>As of 2025 several new factories making semiconductors are being built in Arizona, Texas, and New York. But full freedom won't happen for years because the industry needs a lot of money and there aren't enough skilled people working on new chips. Even so the act is a turning point in industrial policy. With strong government backing the U.S. is back in the global production field.</p>

    <h4>Investment Scrutiny And The Role Of Europe</h4>
    <p>European investments made by China are also getting more and more attention. Some countries like Germany, the UK, and Italy have made it harder for foreign direct investment (FDI) to happen. This is mostly in areas like energy telecoms and key infrastructure. In 2022, more than 60% of Chinese business deals in Europe were either turned down or needed more study.</p>
    <p>The European Union has set up a system for screening FDI across the whole group. This is meant to encourage member states to share U.S. worries about the Chinese impact. As part of the Belt and Road Initiative projects are being looked at again and new rules are being made to protect important businesses.</p>

    <h4>The Global South And Emerging Alignments</h4>
    <p>China's impact on the Global South keeps growing thanks to trade building up infrastructure and political outreach. Countries in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia see Chinese technology and money as options to Western institutions even if they don't have the same political conditions.</p>
    <p>Because of this the West has started projects like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to go against China Belt and Road. Still there is a lot of competition for power in these areas which will shape the next part of the global economy.</p>
